    Bubble sort advances similarly. In every step it compares two adjacent elements and if
    the lower value is on the left side of the higher,
    bubble sort swaps them (lighter value ascends to the end of the array) and with the same
    logic algorithm proceeds to the next item.

  <p>After one iteration the lowest value is located at the end of the array.
    Algorithm now repeats the procedure with reduced array (the last element is already sorted).</p>
