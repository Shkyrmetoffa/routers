  Shaker sort unlike bubble sort orders the array in both directions.
  Hence every iteration of the algorithm consists of two phases. In the
  first one the lightest bubble ascends to the end of the array, in the
  second phase the heaviest bubble descends to the beginning of the array.

  This way an imperfection of bubble sort – the problem of rabbits and
  turtles – is mitigated. The problem of rabbits and turtles is a situation
  in bubble sort, when a heavy bubble is placed at the end of the array.
  While the light bubbles (rabbits) are ascending rapidly, the heavy bubble
  (turtle) descends only one position per each iteration.
